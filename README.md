Data
--------
 - Eddy covariance (EC) ET measurement and its predicted north and south measurements (CSV).

Shapefile
--------
 - Tower flux footprint and its north and south sections
 - PML and MOD16 non-overlapped north and south areas (see Figure 4 in the revised manuscript), each category has three pixels.

Analysis
--------
 - Annual and monthly comparison between EC and remote sensing products, including CMRSET, MOD16, PML, and SEBAL.
 - Fire analysis using Differences-In-Differences approach.
