Overview
--------

This repository is associated with the paper "Satellite and eddy covariance analysis reveals fire-induced changes to Mediterranean woodland evapotranspiration" by Hoang Long Nguyen, Simone Gelsinari, Nikolaus Callow, Richard Silberstein and Sally Thompson (2024).

Data
--------
 - Eddy covariance (EC) ET measurement and its predicted north and south measurements (CSV).
 - SEBAL ET measurement and its north and south representations (CSV).
 - The flux footprint portion of non-overlapped north/south PML and MOD16 pixels. 

Shapefile
--------
 - Tower flux footprint.
 - PML and MOD16 non-overlapped north and south pixels, each category has three pixels.

Analyse
--------
 - Modified geeSEBAL model for the Mediterranean climate. The original version can be found at (https://github.com/gee-hydro/geeSEBAL?tab=readme-ov-file) and is associated with the [open access paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271621001519?via%3Dihub, "geeSEBAL") "Long-term monitoring of evapotranspiration using the SEBAL algorithm and Google Earth Engine cloud computing" by Leonardo Laipelt, Rafael Henrique Bloedow Kayser, Ayan Santos Fleischmann, Anderson Ruhoff, Wim Bastiaanssen, Tyler A. Erickson, Forrest Melton. 
 - Annual and monthly comparison between EC and remote sensing products.
 - Analysis of EC and remote sensing products and their components correlations.
 - Fire analysis using Differences-In-Differences approach.
