Data
--------
 - Eddy covariance (EC) ET measurement and its predicted north and south measurements (CSV).
 - SEBAL ET measurement and its north and south representations (CSV).
 - The flux footprint portion of non-overlapped north/south PML and MOD16 pixels (XLSX). 

Shapefile
--------
 - Tower flux footprint.
 - PML and MOD16 non-overlapped north and south pixels, each category has three pixels.

Analyse
--------
 - Modified geeSEBAL model for the Mediterranean climate based on Laipelt et al (2021) and Awada et al (2019). 
 - Annual and monthly comparison between EC and remote sensing products, including CMRSET, MOD16, PML, and SEBAL.
 - Analysis of EC and remote sensing products and their components correlations.
 - Fire analysis using Differences-In-Differences approach.
